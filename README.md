# googleAuth

while adding callback uri in google oauth api, it errors out with Invalid Redirect: must use a domain that is a valid
top private domain .

due to which google auth isnot mplemented in hosted web app http://ec2-3-84-18-60.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

this is the reason; please try to clone the current repo for authencication using google.

Thank for reading this far :)
